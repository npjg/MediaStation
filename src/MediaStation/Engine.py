#! python3

## This program extracts asets from Media Station titles. Refer to the readme 
## for information on tested titles and known issues.
## Overall Design:
##  - Some of the data structures used in the files are rather strange and suited 
##    for real-time playback instead of asset extraction. So first all the data is
##    read from the files. Each structure in the data files generally has its own
##    class in this application, and structures that correspond to multimedia assets 
##    also support exporting. There is a little bit of inconsistency as to what
##    constitutes a "structure" here as opposed to just a piece of another structure.
##    But the arrangement I have adopted has seemed to preserve conceptual integrity 
##    pretty well.
##  - Each of the classes populated from the data is generally exported to JSON.
##  - Multimedia files are exported to BMP or WAV.
