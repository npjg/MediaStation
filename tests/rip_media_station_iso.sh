# identify the edition of the title in a human-readable fashion. It is designed to
# help with cataloging the many Media Station titles that are out there to create 
# a test dataset.

# In addition, mounting hybrid Windows/HFS CD-ROM images is difficult on modern
# macOS, as even the Windows partition will just refuse to mount with the typical
# double-click. This script encapsulates the complexity required to mount these
# hybrid CD-ROMs on macOS.
